# kAPI Docs

Hi, you've stumbled across our documentation.

Feel free to read through, and try to interact with the API. The important thing to note is that *general users only have access to user-based endpoints*. Although the scope of this documentation is much further than that, and covers internal workings, there is no way for general users to have access to these endpoints. Please don't even try.
